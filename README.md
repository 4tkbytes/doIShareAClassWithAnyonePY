# Do I Share A Class With Anyone?

A python server based website that alows users to check who has the closest link to their classmates. It can be used to make some new friends, or if you are just curious and wanna play around.

## Well, how do i use it then?

Currently, you can access the website on [here](tinyurl.com/doIShareAClassWithAnyone)

Install flask and requests:

```bash
pip install flask requests flask-cors
```

Then run the program (server if testing):

```bash
python app.py
```

The website is pretty simple to navigate. If you want to use your own testing server, you have to choice to input your own server at the top of the website. 

## TODO()

- [X] Turn into website
- [ ] Improve on UI (its very barebones)
- [ ] Add functionality for other schools
