# Do I Share A Class With Anyone?
A python server/client program that will eventually be turned into a website that alows users to check who has the closest link to their classmates. It can be used to make some new friends, or if you are just curious and wanna play around. 

## Well, how do i use it then?
So far, its only used for testing. However if you want to add your data for dummy testing (no bad actors in the equation), then feel free to send me a DM on either Instagram, an issue on GitHub or a PM on Discord. 

Install flask and requests: 
```bash
pip install flask requests
```

Then run the program (server if testing):
```bash
python server.py
```

And in a separate window, run the actual program:
```bash
python main.py
```

The python script is very simple to navigate, and gives reliable information.

## TODO()
- Turn into website
